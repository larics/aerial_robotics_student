# aerial_robotics_student
This repository is used for aerial robotics laboratory exercise. In short, the exercise focuses on Crazyflie UAV control. In the exercise, you are first required to implement PID controller class. This class is then used for cascade height control, yaw control, and cascade x and y controllers.

## Setup
There are several steps for setting up the simulation, all files are located in `readme` folder.

### Step 1
`readme/InstallationInstructions.md` - Installing required components and docker environment with simulation.

### Step 2
`readme/GettingStarted.md` - How to run the simulation and use it effectively

### Step 3
`readme/Tmux.md` - The simulation uses `tmux` for splitting terminals. Check out this readme to acquaint yourself with this environment.
